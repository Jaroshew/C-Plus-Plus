# Graph Implementation with DFS and BFS

This program implements a graph using an adjacency list and provides functionalities for Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Graph Representation**:  
  Efficient adjacency list structure to represent the graph.
- **Edge Management**:  
  - Add edges between vertices.
  - Remove edges dynamically.
- **Graph Traversal**:  
  - **DFS**: Depth-First Search to explore nodes deeply.
  - **BFS**: Breadth-First Search to explore nodes level by level.
- **Default Graph Setup**:  
  Quickly initialize a predefined set of edges for testing.
- **Graph Printing**:  
  Visualize the adjacency list representation of the graph.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Create a graph with a specified number of vertices.
   - Add or remove edges manually or use the default graph setup.
2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - Perform DFS or BFS from a starting vertex to a target vertex.
3. **Graph Visualization**:
   - Print the adjacency list to see the current structure of the graph.
